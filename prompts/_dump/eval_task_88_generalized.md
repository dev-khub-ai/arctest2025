(user) Please summarize the current working rule by generalizing it suitably, so that another chatbot can read it and understand perfectly how it works in order to solve similar problems, even if the problems are not exactly the same as this one.


(Bot) Okay, here is a generalized summary of the rule we refined for Task #88 (which worked for Pairs 1 and 4). This summary attempts to abstract the core logic so another chatbot could potentially adapt it for similar problems, while clarifying points that were confusing during our analysis:

**Rule Summary: Pattern Generation via Local Program Stamping**

**Core Concept:** The transformation identifies local "Program Configurations" in the Input grid. Each configuration uses a "Source Shape" (`S`) and an adjacent "Program Bar" (`c1-c2`) to define a template (`S2`). This template is then repeatedly drawn ("stamped") onto an initially blank Output grid at specific target locations defined by `c2`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create an Output grid of the same dimensions as the Input, filled with the background color (usually 0 - Black).

2.  **Identify All Program Configurations:** Scan the Input grid to find all instances that match the definition of a Program Configuration. A configuration consists of:
    * **A Source Shape (`S`):** This is a shape meeting specific criteria defined by the task.
        * *Task #88 Specific:* `S` was defined as the **minimal bounding box** enclosing a connected component of pixels of **only color 8 (Brown)**, using 8-way adjacency. (Other tasks might define `S` based on different colors, connectivity, or properties).
    * **An Attached Program Bar (`c1-c2`):** This is a small sequence of adjacent "trigger" pixels, `P1` and `P2`, meeting specific criteria:
        * *Task #88 Specific:* It was **exactly two cells**, adjacent (8-way). Their colors (`c1`, `c2`) had to be **non-0 and non-8**. The bar had to be **attached** (at least one bar pixel adjacent 8-way) to the bounding box of `S`. `c1` was defined as the color of the bar pixel (`P1`) **nearer** (e.g., by Manhattan distance) to the closest pixel *within* shape `S`. `c2` was the color of the other bar pixel (`P2`). (Other tasks might use different bar lengths, allowed colors, attachment rules, or nearness definitions).

3.  **Define Exclusion Zones:** Create a comprehensive set containing the coordinates of *all* pixels belonging to:
    * The bounding box of *every* identified Source Shape `S`.
    * The pixels (`P1`, `P2`) of *every* identified Program Bar.
    * *Clarification:* This step is crucial. Excluding *all* program elements prevents programs from targeting themselves or each other, which was necessary for Task #88.

4.  **Execute Each Program:** Process each identified Program Configuration (`S`, `c1`, `c2`, `P1`, `P2`) independently:
    * **a. Create Template (`S2`):** Make a copy of the Source Shape `S` (within its bounding box). In this copy, change the color of all defining pixels (e.g., all 8s in Task #88) to color `c1`. Leave other pixels within the bbox (e.g., 0s) unchanged. This result is the template `S2`.
    * **b. Identify Initial Targets (`T`):** Find the coordinates (`P_T`) of *all* pixels in the *original Input grid* whose color is `c2`.
    * **c. Filter Targets (`T_filtered`):** Remove any coordinate `P_T` from `T` if `P_T` is present in the Exclusion Zones defined in Step 3.
    * **d. Determine Anchor Point (`S_anchor`):** Identify the specific pixel coordinates *within* the original shape `S`'s bounding box that correspond to the part of `S` closest to the `c1` pixel (`P1`) of this program's bar. This relative position within `S` serves as the anchor point for drawing `S2`.
        * *Clarification:* Defining a consistent anchor based on the relative geometry of the bar and shape was essential in Task #88.
    * **e. Draw/Stamp `S2`:** For each target coordinate `P_T` in the filtered set `T_filtered`:
        * Draw the template `S2` onto the **Output grid**.
        * Align `S2` such that the pixel within `S2` corresponding to the `S_anchor` position is placed exactly at the target coordinate `P_T`.
        * Handle grid boundaries by clipping (do not draw outside the grid).
        * If multiple programs draw to the same cell, the last one drawn overwrites previous ones.

5.  **Final Output:** The resulting Output grid after all programs have been processed is the final answer.

**Important Caveat:** This generalized rule structure, derived from analyzing specific hints and examples (Pairs 1 & 4) for Task #88, may not apply universally. Task #88 itself appeared to contain other input patterns (Pairs 2 & 3) that followed fundamentally different transformation rules not covered by this mechanism. Therefore, applying this rule requires first checking if the input pattern matches the specific configuration type this rule addresses.
