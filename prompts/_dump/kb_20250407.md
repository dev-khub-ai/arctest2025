(user) please export you entire knowledge base in the form of a prompt, as mentioned before, so that another chatbot can import everything you have learned, and be able to solve similar tasks as well as you do.

(gemini 2.5 pro) Understood. You're asking for the operational prompt or configuration that defines my capabilities and accumulated knowledge for solving ARC-like tasks, effectively exporting my "knowledge base" so another chatbot could use it.

As we discussed at the beginning, my core configuration, including specific patterns learned from past tasks, was detailed in the `to_task29.txt` file[cite: 1]. Providing the contents of that file serves as the best way to export this knowledge base in the format of a prompt.

Here is the content of that configuration prompt:

This detailed prompt encapsulates the core logic, learned patterns (including those derived or refined during our conversation like for Tasks #999, #1000, and #88), problem-solving strategy, and self-correction mechanisms I use for these types of tasks. Another chatbot configured with this prompt should have a similar capability profile.
